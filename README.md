Code challenge TeaCup

# Java language, implement a simple ceiling fan with these characteristics:#


·  The unit has 2 pull cords:

<li>One increases the speed each time it is pulled.  There are 3 speed settings, and an “off” (speed 0) setting. 

<li>If the cord is pulled on speed 3, the fan returns to the “off” setting.

<li>One reverses the direction of the fan at the current speed setting.

<li>Once the direction has been reversed, it remains reversed as we cycle through the speed settings, until reversed again.

<li>You can assume the unit is always powered (no wall switch)

<li>Include  Unit Test cases as well in the deliverable.
